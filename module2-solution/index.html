   <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a 
     professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin 
     words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and  through the cites of the word in 
     classical literature, discovered the undoubtable.
